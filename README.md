According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 58 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2018. In many countries there's a shortage of radiologists. I created this online tool to help doctors and nurses, who are not radiologists, improve their ability to diagnose TB on chest x-ray images.
